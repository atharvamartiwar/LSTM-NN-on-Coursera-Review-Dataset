# LSTM-NN-on-Coursera-Review-Dataset
We used TFIDF and BOW as the Vectorization Techniques for converting the Textual Data into numerical Data . With our input variable as the Review and prediction variable as Rating we applied LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Memory) model , ANN (artificial neural networks with different layers and different activation function). Then we compared the accuracies of these models .
In brief we used 
1. TFIDF->LSTM (73.8%)
2. TFIDF->ANN with 5 layers (RELU + RELU + RELU + RELU + TANH) (98.47%)!!!!
3. BOW->LSTM (73.99%) 
4. BOW ->ANN with 5 layers (RELU + RELU + RELU + RELU + SIGMOID ) (97.46%) !!!
